TizeNES
=======

Some notes

0. This was a 4 hour Christmas weekend hack.

1. Currently, Relies on the JSNES Project (not me!)

2. Currently, runs like shit on the TV. About half speed. Will try to improve

3. Requires that you have a keyboard plugged in. For some reason keyboard events in Tizen seem TERRIBLE. Could be JS engine being overworked, requires further investigation. Regardless, if you want to use the IR remote for controlling an NES game you're crazy

4. Probably going to have to go native app on this
